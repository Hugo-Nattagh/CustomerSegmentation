### Machine Learning to Find Customer Clusters with Julia

Unsupervised clustering is used to discover pattern in the data. It’s more about exploring data than solving a problem. Even when significant clusters are found, it doesn’t mean it can be useful.

In this script, I do data cleaning and preprocessing, as well as some feature engineering. I then use the k-mean alogrithm form the ‘Clustering’ package to find my clusters.

k-Means is a data grouping algorithm. It delimits, without supervision and with the help of the features, some groups among the data.

The clusters are based, for a customer, on the average amount spent by purchase and the number of distinct days when a purchase was made.
